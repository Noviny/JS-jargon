Currently:

Add new terms
Request terms
Define from requested term list
tweets for request, or when request is defined




CURRENT GOALS!
Make /jargon/:term work! Please. Please please.
Work on the twitter streaming API to see if we can start getting auto-responses
  Check out the joys of other people's tweet bots to see how they are managing this.
  Make a new app that manages that if needed.

Remove passwords so this can be deployed to github.





Todo:

search function for narrowing display terms
<!-- Make auto-twitter functions work
 --><!-- Delete requested term when added -->


css
design




 - Go back to original single model design, normally display all terms with status 'defined'
The undefined add adds the twitter handle bit.
When a term is defined, you just modify it, changing its status to 'defined' and removing the twitter handle AFTER tweeting.





PLEASE do a code runthrough/tidy/backbone lookat



re-examine what displays on the main page and in what order.
