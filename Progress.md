Currently:

Add new terms
Request terms
Define from requested term list
tweets for request, or when request is defined



Todo:

search function for narrowing display terms
<!-- Make auto-twitter functions work
 --><!-- Delete requested term when added -->




 - Go back to original single model design, normally display all terms with status 'defined'
The undefined add adds the twitter handle bit.
When a term is defined, you just modify it, changing its status to 'defined' and removing the twitter handle AFTER tweeting.





PLEASE do a code runthrough/tidy/backbone lookat



re-examine what displays on the main page and in what order.
